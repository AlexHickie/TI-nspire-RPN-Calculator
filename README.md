# TI-nspire RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) Calculator

This calculator is nowhere near as stable as the TI calculator app. If you manage to input incorrect operation the RPN calculator will crash and all data stored in the RPN calculator will be lost. For any lengthy calculation the TI calculator app should be used.

* Pi and e constants
* Trig functions
* Complex Math (Only supports rectangular form)

## Install
Use the TI-nspire student software for your calculator to upload `RPN.tns` to the `MyWidgets` folder on your calculator. The calculator will appear as a widget under the `Add Widgets` menu when you add a page to your document.

## Not Working
* Any external function (e.g. rand() or any other function from the catalog)
* Symbolic math
